# 📊 Student Grades Statistics System (Java)

A simple yet powerful Java application that manipulates a list of student grades using arrays and represents them in the form of a graph

---

## 📌 Features

- Accept student grades from the user
- **Arrays** for storing grades
- Calculates:
  - 📈 **Maximum Grade**
  - 🔝 **Minimum Grade**
  - 🔻 **Average Grade**
- Create a bar graph representing the grades array. (Use the symbols ####### for bar representation and display the grade range below the graph.)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Applied
-Establish an array *stats* of size 5 which is composed as follows:
  - stats[4] contains the number of grades above 80
  - stats[3] contains the number of grades from 61 to 80  
  - stats[2] contains the number of grades from 41 to 60
  - stats[1] contains the number of grades from 21 to 40
  - stats[0] contains the number of grades from 0 to 20
- **Control Flow**: Conditional logic and loops to process grades
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs and edge cases
